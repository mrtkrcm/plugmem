"""Promotion-gate extraction endpoint.

Takes a list of candidates (failure_delta / correction text windows)
and asks the configured LLM to emit 0-N structured memory nodes.
The endpoint does not write to a graph -- the adapter is responsible
for posting the returned memories to /memories with the desired graph_id.
This keeps the contract orthogonal: the adapter owns graph routing,
the server owns LLM access.
