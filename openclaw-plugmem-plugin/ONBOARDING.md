# PlugMem for OpenClaw — Onboarding

Long-term memory for your OpenClaw agent. Installs as a plugin, auto-saves
session trajectories, and gives the agent two tools: `plugmem.remember` and
`plugmem.recall`. This doc takes you from zero to a working memory loop in
about 10 minutes.

## What you'll have when you're done

- A PlugMem service running at `http://localhost:8080`.
- An OpenClaw agent that:
  - Exposes `plugmem.remember` / `plugmem.recall` tools.
  - Automatically stores the session trajectory on `/reset` and before
    context compaction.
  - Recalls prior sessions on demand into the current context.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
- **Node.js 18+** and `npm` (for building the plugin).
- **OpenClaw** host running locally — you'll register the plugin against it.
- **An OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint** (OpenAI, vLLM, Ollama with the
  OpenAI shim, etc.).
- **An embedding endpoint** exposing an OpenAI-compatible `/embeddings`
  route. The server defaults to the `nvidia/NV-Embed-v2` model name — if
  you're pointing at anything else, set `EMBEDDING_MODEL`.

---

## 1. Start the PlugMem service

```bash
cd PlugMem
uv sync
```

Create a `.env` next to `pyproject.toml` (the server reads env vars, not a
dotfile — source this before launching):

```bash
# LLM (required for trajectory structuring + reasoning)
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-..."
export LLM_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"

# Embeddings (required for storage + retrieval)
export EMBEDDING_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8001/v1"
export EMBEDDING_MODEL="nvidia/NV-Embed-v2"   # override if you use another

# Storage
export CHROMA_MODE="persistent"               # or "ephemeral" for throwaway
export CHROMA_PATH="./data/chroma"

# Service auth — pick any string; the plugin must send the same value
export PLUGMEM_API_KEY="dev-key-change-me"
```

Launch:

```bash
source .env
uv run uvicorn plugmem.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Health check (in a second shell):

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health | jq
```

You want `status: "ok"` and all three of `llm_available`,
`embedding_available`, and `storage_available` set to `true`
(`storage_backend` says which backend is in use). If any is `false`, fix
the corresponding env var before continuing — the plugin will appear to
work but memory insertion and retrieval will fail.

## 2. Create your first graph

A graph is a namespace for memories (typically one per agent or per user).
You **must** create it before inserting memories:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/graphs \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-key-change-me" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"graph_id":"my-agent"}'
```

## 3. Build and register the plugin

```bash
cd openclaw-plugmem-plugin
npm install
npm run build
```

Register with OpenClaw. The shape depends on how your host loads plugins,
but the call is always the same:

```ts
import { createPlugMemPlugin } from "@plugmem/openclaw-plugin";

const plugin = createPlugMemPlugin({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
  apiKey: "dev-key-change-me",      // must match PLUGMEM_API_KEY
  defaultGraphId: "my-agent",       // same ID you created in step 2
});

// Inside your OpenClaw host:
plugin.activate(openclawPluginApi);
```

### Config reference

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `baseUrl` | — (required) | No trailing slash needed; stripped automatically. |
| `apiKey` | none | Sent as `X-API-Key`. Required if `PLUGMEM_API_KEY` is set on the server. |
| `defaultGraphId` | none | **Needed for auto-remember.** Without it, `/reset` and compaction hooks silently no-op. |
| `sharedReadGraphIds` | `[]` | Extra graphs fanned in on `recall`. Read-only — writes never target these. See "Shared graphs" below. |
| `timeoutMs` | `30000` | Per-request timeout. |
| `maxRetries` | `3` | Retries on 408/429/502/503/504 with exponential backoff. |
| `autoRemember.onSessionReset` | `true` | Save trajectory when the session resets (`/new`, `/reset`). |
| `autoRemember.onCompaction` | `true` | Save trajectory before context compaction. |
| `autoRemember.minSteps` | `2` | Skip auto-save if the session has fewer (obs, action) pairs. |
| `autoRemember` | — | Set to `false` to disable auto-save entirely. |

## 4. Verify the loop end-to-end

In an OpenClaw session, ask the agent to call the tool directly:

```
Use plugmem.remember with text="The user prefers meetings in the morning" and tags=["user-pref"]
```

Then in the same session (or a new one):

```
Use plugmem.recall with observation="When does the user like to meet?"
```

You should see an LLM-synthesized answer grounded in the stored memory.
Confirm it landed:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/graphs/my-agent/stats \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-key-change-me" | jq
```

`stats.semantic` should be `>= 1`.

## 5. What the agent sees

### `plugmem.remember`

Three modes, picked by which params you pass:

- **Semantic** — `text` (+ optional `tags`). One-liner facts, user
  preferences, domain knowledge.
- **Procedural** — `subgoal` + `procedural_text`. A recipe or sequence
  of steps that worked for a known subgoal.
- **Trajectory** — `goal` + `steps[{observation, action}]`. A full
  agent run. PlugMem's structuring pipeline will extract semantic,
  procedural, and episodic memories from it.

### `plugmem.recall`

Takes an `observation` (required) and optional `goal`, `mode`, `raw`. The
default return is an LLM-synthesized answer over the top-ranked
memories. Pass `raw: true` to get the retrieval prompt without synthesis —
useful when you want to feed the memories into your own prompt.

Supports optional filtering:
- `source_in`: Only return memories with specific source types (correction, explicit, etc.).
- `min_confidence`: Minimum confidence threshold (0.0–1.0).
- `provenance_filters`: Restrict recall by provenance metadata. Example:
  `{"language": ["python"], "repo": ["org/my-repo"]}`.

### `plugmem.promote`

Extract durable memory nodes from coding signals and store them. Accepts
a list of `candidates`, each with a `kind` (correction, failure_delta,
explicit, repeated_lookup) and a `window` of text describing the signal.

Returns inserted node IDs and any rejected candidates with reasons.

```text
Use plugmem.promote with candidates=[{kind: "correction", window: "use uv, not pip"}]
```

### Auto-remember

Fires on two hooks:

- `before_reset` — user runs `/new` or `/reset`.
- `before_compaction` — OpenClaw is about to compact older messages
  out of context. The plugin falls back to reading the session JSONL
  file because current OpenClaw builds don't populate `event.messages`
  on this hook.

Both paths convert the OpenClaw message log to `(observation, action)`
steps and post a trajectory to `defaultGraphId`. Failures are logged to
`stderr` and swallowed — they won't crash the session.

## Shared graphs (cross-agent memory)

Procedural and episodic memories don't generalize across agents — a calendar
agent shouldn't be retrieving a coding agent's tool traces. Semantic
memories (user preferences, facts about the user) *do* generalize. To get
that without polluting either agent's main graph:

1. Create a user-level graph once:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/graphs \
     -H "X-API-Key: dev-key-change-me" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"graph_id":"user-facts"}'
   ```

2. Point every agent's plugin at it as a read-only fan-in:
   ```ts
   createPlugMemPlugin({
     baseUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
     apiKey: "dev-key-change-me",
     defaultGraphId: "calendar-agent",        // writes go here
     sharedReadGraphIds: ["user-facts"],       // also read on recall
   });
   ```

3. To populate `user-facts`, call `plugmem.remember` with an explicit
   `graph_id`:
   ```
   plugmem.remember(graph_id="user-facts", text="User prefers async standups", tags=["user-pref"])
   ```

On `recall`, the plugin fans out to `[defaultGraphId, ...sharedReadGraphIds]`
in parallel and labels each section in the response:

```
[graph:calendar-agent | episodic_memory]
<reasoning over calendar-agent memories>

---

[graph:user-facts | semantic_memory]
<reasoning over user-facts memories>
```

If a shared graph 404s or times out, the call still succeeds — the failing
graph appears as `[graph:X | error]` and the rest of the response is intact.

Writes (`plugmem.remember` without an explicit `graph_id`, auto-remember
hooks) always go to `defaultGraphId` only. The shared list is read-only by
design.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `/api/v1/health` returns `llm_available: false` | `LLM_BASE_URL` / `LLM_API_KEY` / `LLM_MODEL` not set or endpoint unreachable. |
| `plugmem.remember` returns `404` | Graph doesn't exist. Run the `POST /graphs` call from step 2. |
| `plugmem.remember` returns `401` | `apiKey` in plugin config doesn't match server's `PLUGMEM_API_KEY`. |
| Auto-remember never fires | `defaultGraphId` not set, or session had `< minSteps` turns. Check server stderr for `[plugmem] auto-remember` lines. |
| `recall` returns empty reasoning | Graph exists but has no memories yet, or query embedding misses. Check `/stats`. |
| Embedding errors on insert | `EMBEDDING_MODEL` mismatch with your endpoint. Default is `nvidia/NV-Embed-v2`. |

## Claude Code Integration

PlugMem also ships as a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io)
server for **Claude Code**. It provides three tools: `plugmem_remember`,
`plugmem_recall`, and `plugmem_promote`.

### Setup

The MCP server lives at `claude-code-plugmem-plugin/server.py`. Configure it
in your Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude/settings.json` or project-level
`.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plugmem": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/absolute/path/to/PlugMem/claude-code-plugmem-plugin",
        "server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PLUGMEM_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
        "PLUGMEM_API_KEY": "dev-key-change-me",
        "PLUGMEM_DEFAULT_GRAPH": "coding-agent"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/PlugMem` with the actual path. The server uses `uv`
to run — no separate install step needed.

### Auto-create graph

The server does **not** auto-create the graph on startup. Do it once:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/graphs \
  -H "X-API-Key: dev-key-change-me" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"graph_id":"coding-agent"}'
```

Or use the CLI scaffold (recommended — also seeds language conventions):

```bash
plugmem coding scaffold --language python
```

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `plugmem_remember` | Store a semantic memory (text + tags), procedural memory (subgoal + procedural_text), or full trajectory (goal + steps). Supports source, confidence, and coding provenance (repo, language, tool_name, etc.). |
| `plugmem_recall` | Retrieve relevant memories. Supports source type filtering (`source_in`), confidence threshold (`min_confidence`), retrieval mode override (`mode`), provenance filtering (`provenance_filters`), and raw prompt output (`raw`). |
| `plugmem_promote` | Extract and store durable memory from a coding signal (correction, failure delta, etc.). Returns node IDs and rejection reasons. |

### Example: Claude Code memory loop

Once configured, Claude Code automatically has access to the three tools.
The agent can remember facts, recall past sessions, and promote coding signals
all within the conversation:

```
You: Remember that I prefer uv over pip for Python dependency management.

Claude: *calls plugmem_remember with text="User prefers uv over pip"*
        Remembered. ✓

You: (in a new conversation) How should I manage Python dependencies?

Claude: *calls plugmem_recall with observation="Python dependency management"*
        Based on your past sessions, you prefer using uv over pip.
```

For coding-agent workflows with provenance:

```
You: Note: always format Python code with ruff format, not black.

Claude: *calls plugmem_remember with text="Format Python code with ruff format"
        source="correction", language="python", tool_name="ruff"*
        Remembered. ✓
```
